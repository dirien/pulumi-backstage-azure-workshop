# Chapter 4: Housekeeping!

<img src="docs/static/media/chap5.png">

In this chapter, we'll undertake some cleanup. We will delete all resources we set up during the
workshop.

### Prerequisites

- The Pulumi [CLI](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/get-started/install/)

## Instructions

### Step 1 - Destroy your infrastructure with Pulumi

Depending on your progress in the workshop, you have to destroy more or less resources and stacks. We will assume that
you only created a single stack:

```bash
cd backstage-azure-infrastructure
pulumi destroy
```

Follow the instructions on the screen to destroy the stack.

### Step 2 - Now Celebrate, You're Done!
